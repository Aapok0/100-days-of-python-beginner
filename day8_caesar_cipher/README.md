# [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

This is an ancient cipher used by the romans during Julius Caesar's time to encode messages in the military. It shifts letters by a determined amount and can be decoded by knowing the amount letters were shifted. It is not sophisticated or secure compared to modern ciphers, but is being implemented here for practice.
