# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023

## Beginner

These projects are a part of a [Udemy Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). They are supposed to span the first 15 days as the beginner part of the course. Some of the code like ASCII-art, lists and starting print statements are from the course's starting code so as to spend time mostly on the functionality of the projects and learning.
